# Library-Management-system
This project is a Library Management System built using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and SQL for database connectivity. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing books, students, and transactions such as borrowing and returning books. The system enables librarians to add new books,track the availability of books, and manage student records. By integrating SQL for database operations, the system ensures efficient storage and retrieval of data, making it a practical tool for small- to medium-sized libraries. This project showcases how Tkinter and SQL can work together to create a functional and intuitive management system.
